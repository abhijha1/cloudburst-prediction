### Describe your idea/Solution/Prototype here:
⮚ Analysis of altitudes ranging from 3 to 7 KMdue to its susceptibility to cloud burst events.
⮚ We employ cutting-edge wind mapping technology to track moisture-laden wind patterns. We will monitor the movementof these winds in real-time.
⮚ We cross-reference wind data with weather maps to identifylocations where cumulus clouds are above nimbus clouds topredict cloudbursts.
⮚ Factors influencing cloud burst are cloud volume and regional temperature.
⮚ Our approach not only predicts cloud burst events but also contributes valuable insights to weather forecasting.
⮚ It aids in disaster preparedness efforts, ultimately helping mitigate the risks associated with these natural phenomena.
